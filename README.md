# Project-Matlab
Program completely developed in MATLAB that extracts data from an OpenFAST file by generating an exhaustive interface for the user.
The following options are made available to user:
- The user can read data from an OpenFAST file (2021) and the program will generate a complete interface where the user will be able to manipulate the file.
- The user can create, import or export, current or new file for OpenFAST purposes.
- The user can also input geometrical wind turbine parameters, the application will be able to visualize on a 2D blueprint the object that is being created,
there are currently the following measures:
- Small
- Medium
- Big 
- Measurements are considered accordig to the user input, all files must be in place in order to visualize the above mentioned data.
